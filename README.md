WPSEO Nuke Noob Stuff
=====================

A simple WordPress plugin to nuke the noob things in WP SEO by Yoast.

### It currently disables the following
- "All SEO Scores" dropdown select on posts page
- "SEO: (dot) Check" in Publish metabox
- "Page Analysis" tab in posts metabox

#### What else I want it to do later
- "SEO" dropdown from admin tool bar
- "Focus Keyword" column on posts page
- "SEO" dot column on posts page
- "Focus Keyword" stuff in the post screen metabox
- WPSEO dashboard metabox


All respect for the WPSEO crew still. A while ago I opened a proposal in their github repo to address this: [https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/869](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/869) 

But until then here's a plugin to do it.

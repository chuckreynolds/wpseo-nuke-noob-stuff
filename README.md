WPSEO Nuke Noob Stuff
=====================

A simple WordPress plugin to nuke the noob things in WP SEO by Yoast. It currently removes the following:
- "All SEO Scores" dropdown select on posts page
- "Focus Keyword" column on posts page
- "SEO" dot column on posts page
- "Focus Keyword" stuff in the posts metabox
- "Page Analysis" tab in posts metabox
- "SEO: (dot) Check" in Publish metabox

All respect for the WPSEO crew still. For reference I opened a proposal in their github repo to address this: [https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/869](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/869) 

But until then here's a plugin to do it.

Built to extend WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin by removing some of the super basic noob things like page analysis etc

== Description ==
This WordPress plugin is built to extend and remove the noob things in the WordPress SEO (WPSEO) plugin by Yoast for you or clients who don't care and just want a good plain technical WPSEO plugin.

**It currently diables the following**
* "All SEO Scores" dropdown select on posts & pages listings
* SEO dot, SEO Title, Meta Desc, & Focus KW columns on posts & pages listings
* "SEO: (dot) Check" in publish metabox
* "Page Analysis" tab in posts metabox

**What else I want it to do later if ever possible**
* "SEO" dropdown from admin bar. doesn't annoy enough to fix
* "Focus Keyword" input section and entire tab in the post/page screen metabox

All respect to the WPSEO crew (joostdevalk & team) still. A while ago I opened a proposal in their github repo to address this: [#WPSEO Issue #869](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/869)

Feel free to comment in there that you want this implemented as an option or a more advanced filter - But until then here's a plugin to do it.

If you think you'd like to contribute [on Github](https://github.com/chuckreynolds/wpseo-nuke-noob-stuff), that'd be rad.

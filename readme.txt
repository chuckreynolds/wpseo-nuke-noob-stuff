Built to extend WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin by removing some of the super basic noob things like page analysis for you or clients who don't care and just want a good plain technical WPSEO plugin.

== Description ==
This WordPress plugin is built to extend and remove the noob things in the WordPress SEO (WPSEO) plugin by Yoast.

**It currently disables the following**
* "All SEO Scores" dropdown select on posts page
* "SEO: (dot) Check" in Publish metabox
* "Page Analysis" tab in posts metabox

**What else I want it to do later if ever possible**
* "SEO" dropdown from admin tool bar
* "Focus Keyword" column on posts page
* "SEO" dot column on posts page
* "Focus Keyword" stuff in the post screen metabox
* WPSEO dashboard metabox (technically I could add that filter in now - but currently disabled via my [Selfish Fresh Start](https://wordpress.org/plugins/selfish-fresh-start/) plugin)

All respect for the WPSEO crew (joostdevalk & barrykooij) still. A while ago I opened a proposal in their github repo to address this: [#WPSEO Issue #869](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/869) 

Feel free to comment in there that you want this implemented as an option or a more advanced filter - But until then here's a plugin to do it.

If you think you'd like to contribute [on Github](https://github.com/chuckreynolds/wpseo-nuke-noob-stuff), that'd be rad.
